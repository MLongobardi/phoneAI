# PhoneAI - A Phone Listing Website

**PhoneAI** is a simple phone listing website built with **SvelteKit**. It displays a range of mobile phones along with their details such as name, description, brand, price, release date, and rating. The site also features sorting and filtering functionalities, powered by Svelte stores, that allow users to filter phones by price and rating.

This site was designed and built **entirely with the assistance of ChatGPT**, from the initial setup of the project to the final design. Every line of code, including the components, styles, data structures, and routing logic, was generated by ChatGPT based on user input and requirements.

## Project Setup

### 1. **Creating the SvelteKit Project**

The project was initialized using **SvelteKit**, which is a modern framework for building fast, optimized websites. The following commands were used:

```bash
npm create svelte@next phoneai
cd phoneai
npm install
```

This set up the basic SvelteKit environment.

### 2. **Building the Components**

The site was built with several Svelte components, each responsible for specific sections of the webpage.

#### Key Components:
- **App.svelte**: The root component that imports and renders other components like `Header`, `Footer`, `Main`, and `Sidebar`.
- **Header.svelte**: Contains the navigation menu, including links to different sections of the site like the homepage, about page, and other links.
- **Footer.svelte**: Displays links to "Terms of Service", "Privacy Policy", and "Contact Us", with a mailto link for "Contact Us".
- **Main.svelte**: Displays the phone listings in a grid format. It receives filtered phone data as a prop from the parent component or store.
- **Sidebar.svelte**: Allows users to filter the phone listings by price and rating.
- **ItemCard.svelte**: Represents a single phone in the listings, displaying its name, description, price, rating, and release date.
- **+layout.svelte**: A layout file that wraps the content with global styles, including the header and footer for all pages.
- **+page.svelte**: The main page component that renders the homepage content.

### 3. **Defining the Data Structure**

The dataset for the phones is defined as an array of phone objects, each with properties like:

- **Name**: The phone model name.
- **Description**: A brief description of the phone.
- **Brand**: The brand of the phone (e.g., Apple, Samsung).
- **Price**: The price of the phone.
- **Release Date**: The year the phone was released.
- **Rating**: The user rating of the phone, on a scale of 0-5.

The dataset was initially created with basic information about each phone, and then expanded to include additional details like `Release Date` and `Rating`.

### 4. **Adding Filtering and Sorting**

To make the site more interactive, filtering by **Price** and **Rating** was implemented:

- A **store** was created in a `stores.js` file to manage the state of filters.
- The sidebar component (`Sidebar.svelte`) allows users to select a price range and rating range.
- The `Main.svelte` component dynamically filters the phones based on the selected criteria by using Svelte's `$page` store.

---

### 5. **Routing**

The site includes multiple routes using **SvelteKit's filesystem-based routing**. These routes are automatically created by the following files:

- **/+page.svelte**: The homepage route, which renders the main content and includes the phone listing.
- **/about**: A route that introduces the site with some information about its purpose.
- **/terms**: A route for the Terms of Service page.
- **/privacy-policy**: A route for the Privacy Policy page.

The routing was designed so that all pages inherit the layout from the `+layout.svelte` file, which includes the header, footer, and main content.

---

### 6. **Styling**

CSS was written directly within Svelte components using the scoped `<style>` block. The site uses a combination of Flexbox and Grid to make the layout responsive:

- **Body and Layout Styling**: The body uses Flexbox to ensure the footer always sticks to the bottom of the page.
- **Grid System for Phones**: The phone listing is displayed in a grid, which automatically adjusts depending on the screen size.
- **Hover Effects**: A subtle hover effect was added to the phone cards to improve the user experience.

---

### 7. **Font and Global Styles**

The site uses the **Roboto** font, imported directly in the `<svelte:head>` section of `+layout.svelte`. Global styles for the body include setting the margin to `0` and applying a minimum height of `100vh` to ensure the page stretches to the full viewport height.
